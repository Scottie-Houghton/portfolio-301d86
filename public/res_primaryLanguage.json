      "description": "üëã My name is Scottie Houghton and I am Software Developer looking to use my knowledge, skills and experience in this area, and my other previous career paths, to benefit my next employer and help us both succeed. In past roles, I have found myself working in live music production and music marketing and promotion. My most recent positions focused on administrative work and office management. Even though I have excelled in all I have done, the growth and passion I was looking for in a career was not there. The qualities and skills that I have honed in my professional life are now backed with my knowledge in software development. I look forward to putting this all together for a long career in the tech industry and to succeed in something I am passionate about. Thank you üíú",
